GENERAL

The sequence once things are set up is:

commit	-- changes in local edits
pull	-- verify there are no conflicts (collisions)
push	-- update your changes on the repository

USEFUL GIT COMMANDS

1. git clone		Clone the repository and download to local machine (do once at setup)
2. git pull		Gets any recent changes from repository
			Do this with great frequency as it captures changes by others
			A pull overwrites the local copy, so be careful!
3. git add FILENAME	When a new file is created, it happens locally, but one doesn't
			necessarily want to add it to the repository.  (Like these notes.)
			To add a file to the repository, specify it specifically after creation
4. git commit -a	Saves changes locally to the repository (add commit message to
			produce a log of changes)
5. git push		After a file is committed, send the changes to the repository

For other things like reverting to prior version, Google exists.

Similarly, to have GitHub serve a web site, watch a video.

If there are commit conflicts, commit will indicate the conflicts.
